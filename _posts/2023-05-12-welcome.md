# Welcom to ŚeraGÓta.

I'm Jayesh Dutt Bohra, and I'll be sharing insights related to cybersecurity, particularly focusing on topics that have posed challenges or where I've gained new knowledge through determination and exploration.<br>
P.S - Don't bother Googling the word I dropped in the topic; You will not find any &#128521;.

## About Me

A mere Btech student, like any other young individual on this planet, but driven by curiosity, exploration, and elucidation.
