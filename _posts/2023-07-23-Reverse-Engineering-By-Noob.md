#### The Initiation
Starting with anything is always a tough job for me, where to start, how to start, where to look for and thinkgs like that.
I did a lot of 'em and specially the last one.  So, here I am, ready to chat about all these thingsâ€”what I've tried (which you might want to avoid) and what I should've tried (but didn't).  Phew that was a mouthfull, anyways <br> 
**Let's Get started**

#### What you'll learn
- Setting up a safe virtual environment. ([Note](#) We will only talk about reversing basic application in this project, but still safety first.)
- Going over operating system and assembly concepts.
- Disassembler, Debuggers, & Information Gathering
- Narrow down specific information and indicators before moving on to deeper static and dynamic analysis.
- How to jump into code in static disassembly then rename and comment on interesting assembly routines that you will debug.

Let's cover the basics first, So what exactly is reverse engineering ? and who exactly is a Reverse Engineer ?
<br>
- A Reverse engineering is akin to disassembling a device to uncover its inner workings and understand how it functions. 
- A reverse engineer is an individual who practices this [ART](#) Dismantling objects to unravel their workings, enjoying the challenge of puzzles, devising experiments and tools, embracing unconventional thinking, and maintaining a thirst for continual learning.
